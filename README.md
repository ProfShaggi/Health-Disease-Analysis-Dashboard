### 📁 Project Summary
This project involves building an interactive Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard in Power BI to understand survival patterns, demographic trends, and the clinical factors influencing heart disease outcomes. The visualization summarizes key metrics, including survival rate, age distribution, serum creatinine levels, ejection fraction, and lifestyle-related risk factors.

The dataset contains clinical records of heart-disease patients, including age, gender, smoking status, serum creatinine, ejection fraction, and death events.

---
### 🎯 Project Objectives

- Analyse survival outcomes among heart-disease patients.

- Identify age groups with the highest mortality and lowest survival rate.

- Understand the influence of clinical indicators (serum creatinine & ejection fraction) on patient survival.

- Explore the impact of lifestyle and medical factors such as smoking, diabetes, anaemia, and high blood pressure.

- Build a visually intuitive dashboard for healthcare decision-making.

### 📈 Insights from the Dashboard

#### 1. *_Age-Based Survival Patterns_*

- The 51–60 and 61–70 age groups showed the highest number of survivors.

- There is a decline in survival rate as age increases, particularly from 71+, indicating age is a strong determinant of mortality.

#### 2. *_Serum Creatinine vs Survival_*

- Elevated serum creatinine levels (a sign of kidney dysfunction) correlate with lower survival counts.

- Age group 71+ showed relatively higher creatinine levels, aligning with the higher mortality seen in this group.

#### 3. *_Ejection Fraction (Heart Pumping Efficiency)_*

- Lower ejection fractions are associated with lower survival.

- Age group 51–60 had the highest survival count and moderate ejection fraction levels.

- As ejection fraction declines, the likelihood of death increases.

#### 4. *_Lifestyle & Medical Risk Factors_*
#### The analysis of smoking, diabetes, anaemia, and high blood pressure showed:

- Patients aged 71+ exhibited the highest clustering of multiple risk factors, explaining the lower survival rates in this group.

- The 51–60 group maintained better survival even with moderate risk factors—possibly due to early medical intervention.

#### 5. *_Gender Breakdown_*

- Both genders were analysed, with survival patterns largely similar.
- Males appeared slightly more represented in the higher-risk categories.

#### 📌 Conclusion

This dashboard provides actionable clinical insights that can guide preventive interventions, especially for older patients or those with elevated serum creatinine, low ejection fraction, and multiple risk factors such as HBP, diabetes, or smoking. It demonstrates the effectiveness of Power BI in transforming medical data into actionable insights for informed decision-making.
